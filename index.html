            <p>Seward Park is a 300 acre park situated on a small peninsula on the western edge of Lake Washington in Seattle, WA. The park is primarily made up of old growth forest, and features extensive paths and trails for walking or biking, beaches, an amphitheatre, native plant garden, art studio, playground and more.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>Seward park was originally created by the second continental glacier 13,000 years ago, in the same process that formed Lake Washington. Late in the 19th century, when the city of Seattle was first being developed, it was proposed for the city to purchase the peninsula (known as Bailey Peninsula) making up modern Seward Park. In 1911, the city of Seattle purchased the peninsula and named it after a previous secretary of state, William H. Seward, who had completed the purchase of Alaska as a US state.<br>Later, in 1917, the lakes water level would be lowered by the construction of the ship canal, exposing more land for the park. In 1953, the amphitheatre was constructed in greek styled architecture, and was the setting of many theatrical productions, many directed by Gustave Stern.</p>
