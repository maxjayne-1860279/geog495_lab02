        <h2 class="subhead">Old Growth Forests and Nurse Logs</h2>
        <p>The forests that make up the majority of Seward Park are old-growth forests, named for taking over 175 years to develop. Theses old-growth forests are home to massive trees, themselves home to many different species of plants and animals. When these trees fall, they leave behind an abundance of nutrients in their bodies, allowing other plants to use them as a 'nurse log' from which to grow.</p>

        <h2 class="subhead">Fire Ecology</h2>
        <p>Some of the plant species native to Seward Park are fire-adapted prairie plants such as the Garry Oak and poison oak. These fire-adapted species have come under higher risk after the development of the city of Seattle and the resulting fire suppression in the surrounding area. In the past, Indigenous tribes would encourage and practice burnings to support the prairie ecosystem that they hunted and foraged from. Now many of these species are in decline.</p>

        <h2 class="subhead">Native Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Though Seward Park is a relatively small old growth forest, and cannot support such a rich and diverse ecosystem as found in many larger, less isolated old growth forests, many species still make their homes here. Small mammals, birds, insects and invertebrae are found throughout, and many plant and fungi species live in harmony with the maassive trees that make up the forest. Seward Park's old growth forest used to also be home to mink species before being trapped in 1941, and black tailed deer that would swim from Mercer Island until 1952. More deatils on the species that currently inhabit the old growth forest can be found on the next pages.</p>
